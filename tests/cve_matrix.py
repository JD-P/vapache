"""Build and validate the Apache HTTP Server CVE triage matrix.

The source data is the NVD CPE query for `cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server`
(371 CVEs at the time this matrix was built).  Classification is a *static
triage* of whether the current Vapache specification/implementation boundary
would prevent the vulnerability in principle.  It is not a claim that every
CVE has a working PoC replay test.

Status meanings:
  prevented      construction/verified primitive prevents the primitive
  fail_closed    unsupported feature/config is rejected or returns 500
  not_applicable feature/platform absent
  partial        some relevant layer is verified; the whole class is not
  not_covered    implemented behavior is outside the formal spec
  needs_review   classifier could not decide
