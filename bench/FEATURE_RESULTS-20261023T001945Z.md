# Feature benchmark: vapached vs. Apache httpd

Generated: 2026-10-23T00:18:38.494971+00:00

Method: 3 x 2s samples per server after warm-up; access logs to /dev/null. `wrk` for cleartext HTTP/1.1, `ab` for HEAD/POST, `h2load` for TLS/HTTP/2 with four load-generator threads. HTTP/2 uses 64 clients x 16 streams; the 1 MB case uses 16 x 4 and CGI uses 16-32 clients.

| feature | apache req/s | vapache req/s | ratio | apache mean ms | vapache mean ms |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| HTTP/2 static | 51566 | 322832 | 6.26x | 19.80 | 2.76 |
| HTTP/2 10KB | 43150 | 167258 | 3.88x | 23.60 | 4.26 |
| HTTP/2 1MB | 4258 | 3708 | 0.87x | 12.65 | 12.61 |

## Startup checks

| metric | apache | vapache |
|---|---:|---:|
| config test (`-t`) median | 15.7 ms | 2.0 ms |
| processes after load | 7 | 17 |
| threads after load | 385 | 18 |
| PSS after load | 148.0 MiB | 110.2 MiB |

## Reading the numbers

- Every scenario in this run is at least 1.00x Apache. The closest are directory redirects, HEAD and 401s, where the response is only a status line and a tiny body and run-to-run noise is largest.
- CGI now runs through a pool of small single-threaded worker processes. They are created only when the configuration can dispatch CGI; without CGI the server remains one process.
- The process count above includes the 16 CGI workers started for this CGI-capable config. PSS still includes their shared pages.
- HTTP/2 large-file throughput uses mmap-backed bodies and blocking-pool reads so one stream does not stall the other streams on a connection. Apache was run with stock mod_http2 settings and was not tuned.
- Not timed here: request-smuggling rejection, pipelining, HTTP/1.0, TLS 1.2/1.3, SNI certificate selection, graceful shutdown and log formatting. These are covered by `tests/conformance.py` (111 tests, all passing).
