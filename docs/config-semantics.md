# Configuration semantics: model and proof plan

This document is the bridge between the implementation and a future
machine-checked model of Apache configuration semantics.  It is deliberately
smaller than the full Apache directive set.  The goal is to define the
security-relevant core precisely enough to prove, and to state exactly which
parts are still implementation detail.

The running implementation now uses `policy_ref::effective_scope_with_layers`
for both configuration phases and access-file interleaving.  The access-file
walker only parses files and builds `AccessLayer` values; it does not merge
them.  This discharges the production equivalence obligation by
construction: there is one evaluator, not two.  The phase plan and the
security-relevant merge decisions are now Verus-checked and consumed by that
evaluator (counts and exact boundaries in §10a).  Container/list merging,
directive disposition and `.htaccess` layer-slot translation use verified
helpers; raw parser tokenization remains the explicit parser-refinement
assumption.

## 1. Scope of the model

In scope:

- request path canonicalization and vhost selection
- `<Directory>`, `<DirectoryMatch>`, `<Files>`, `<FilesMatch>`,
  `<Location>`, `<LocationMatch>`
- `<If>`, `<ElseIf>`, `<Else>`, `<IfFile>`
- `<Limit>`, `<LimitExcept>`, method scoping, `AllowMethods`
- `AllowOverride`, `AllowOverrideList`, `Nonfatal=...`, `AllowOverride`
  categories, `.htaccess`
- `Require`, `<RequireAll>`, `<RequireAny>`, `<RequireNone>`, `AuthMerging`
- `Satisfy`, legacy `Order`/`Allow`/`Deny`
- `Options` merge algebra and `AllowOverride Options=...`
- cache-enable/disable prefix selection (for the prefilter invariant)

Out of scope for the first proof:

- TLS, HTTP/2 wire framing, CGI, proxy protocol details, rewrite substitution
- authorization backends (file/Digest/LDAP)
- regex implementation correctness (the model assumes a trusted `Regex`
  matcher with a stated language)
- filesystem race semantics beyond the `openat` containment argument
- logging and response formatting

## 2. Domains

Let:

- `Path` be a canonical absolute filesystem path.
- `Url` be a canonical absolute URL path with no `.`/`..` and a preserved
  trailing slash.
- `Method` be an HTTP method token, with the Apache-equivalence
  `HEAD ~ GET`.
- `Request` carry `(method, url, headers, peer, env)`.
- `Config` be the compiled immutable configuration.
- `Scope` be the merged directive state for a directory.
- `Rule` be `(kind, delta, order, condition, branch, chain, nested)`.
- `Phase` be one of `Directory < Files < Location < Condition`.
- `Match` be one of `Always`, `Directory(pattern)`, `DirectoryMatch(regex)`,
  `Files(pattern)`, `FilesGlob(pattern)`, `FilesMatch(regex)`,
  `Location(prefix)`, `LocationGlob(pattern)`, `LocationMatch(regex)`.

The implementation's `RulePhase` and `ScopeRule::phase` are the code-level
counterparts of `Phase`.

## 3. Matching

For a request `(url, fs_path, fname)`:

- `Directory(pattern)` matches a directory ancestor of `fs_path`, or
  `fs_path` itself (including the file's own path when the pattern's
  component count equals the mapped path's, F61-C), using Apache shell-glob
  semantics with `*`, `?`, `[]`, `[!...]` and `[^...]`.  Wildcards do not
  cross `/`.
- `DirectoryMatch(regex)` matches the **full filesystem filename string**
  (observed Apache 2.4 behavior).  A pattern anchored at a directory name
  without allowing for the final filename does not match a file inside it.
- `Files(pattern)` and `FilesMatch(regex)` match the basename `fname`.
  `<Files>` patterns support `*`, `?`, `[]`, `[!...]`, `[^...]` (F62/F62b:
  both markers negate a class); `~ regex` is regex.
- `Location(prefix)`:
  - `/` or empty matches everything.
  - a prefix **not** ending in `/` matches exactly the prefix or a
    slash-boundary child;
  - a prefix ending in `/` matches only strings that begin with that exact
    prefix.  Thus `/admin/` does not match `/admin`.
- `LocationGlob(pattern)` is a `<Location>` argument containing shell
  wildcards (`*`, `?`, `[...]`): the verified fnmatch kernel evaluates it in
  path mode — component-bounded, anchored, and `*` never crosses `/`
  (F61-A/A2/B).  A `~` first argument compiles the rest as a regex
  (`LocationMatch`); `<Location ~>` with no expression is a configuration
  error (fail closed).
- `LocationMatch(regex)` matches the canonical URL path.

## 4. Merge order

For one request define:

```
D = apply literal <Directory>/<DirectoryMatch> rules and .htaccess,
    interleaved from the root directory down to the target directory
F = apply <Files>/<FilesMatch> rules
L = apply <Location>/<LocationMatch> rules
C = apply <If>/<ElseIf>/<Else> conditionals
```

The effective scope is:

```
effective = C( L( F( D( base ) ) ) )
```

More precisely:

1. Walk directories root-to-leaf.  At each directory:
   1. apply matching literal/wildcard `<Directory>` rules, in
      least-specific-to-most-specific order;
   2. read that directory's access file if `AllowOverride` permits it and
      the file exists, and merge its **top-level** scope;
   3. defer its `<Files>` rules to phase `F` and its `<If>` rules to phase `C`.
2. Apply `<DirectoryMatch>` rules after all directory/access-file merges.
3. Apply `<Files>` rules from the configuration and from access files.
4. Apply `<Location>` rules.
5. Apply `<If>`/`<ElseIf>`/`<Else>` rules last, evaluating chains in order.

The implementation enforces this ordering with:

- `effective_scope_req_base_deferred` (base + top-level deferred rules)
- `apply_directory_rules_for_dir` (per-directory Directory rules)
- `apply_directory_match_rules`
- `apply_normal_rule_list` (Files then Location)
- `apply_deferred_req` (conditionals)

The fast path when no access file can apply uses
`effective_scope_req_deferred`, which folds Directory, Files and Location in
one pass because there is no access file to interleave.

## 5. Scope merge

`Scope::merge(child)` is a per-field operation, not a textual replacement:

- scalar overrides (`document_root`, `allow_override`, `auth_type`, ...)
  replace when present;
- `Options` is a sequence of `Set`/`Add`/`Remove`, applied left-to-right
  from the built-in default `FollowSymLinks`;
- `Require` is replaced by a child `Require` unless the child sets
  `AuthMerging And|Or`, in which case the child policy is combined with the
  inherited policy;
- every append-only container/list field appends parent then child;
- a child `Header set` replaces an inherited field of the same name instead of
  emitting a duplicate; `Header unset` removes inherited set/add fields;
  `Header always` lists are merged separately and also apply to error
  responses;
- `ErrorDocument` and `RewriteMap` are list-backed; a reverse lookup makes
  child entries win for duplicate keys;
- `RewriteRule`/`RewriteCond` lists append;
- `.htaccess` top-level directives merge in the same way.

The formal model should define `merge : Scope × Scope → Scope` as the
composition of these per-field operations and prove the ordering lemmas used
by the phases above.

## 6. Override gating

`AllowOverride` is valid only in a non-regex `<Directory>` section.  A
`None` mode means access files are not read at all.  For a read access file:

- `All` permits every implemented directive;
- each category permits its directive group;
- `AllowOverrideList` permits individual directive names even when
  `AllowOverride None` would otherwise disable access files; the effective
  permission set is the union of both;
- `Nonfatal=Override|Unknown|All` suppresses category/unknown errors while a
  genuine syntax error in a valid directive still fails with 500;
- `Options=...` permits an `Options` token only if the corresponding option
  is listed, except that `Options None` is always permitted once any
  `Options` override is enabled;
- the section containers `<If>`, `<IfFile>`, `<Files>`, `<FilesMatch>` do not
  themselves require a category; the directives **inside** them do;
- `<Limit>`/`<LimitExcept>` are permitted by `AuthConfig` or `Limit`, and
  their inner authorization directives still obey their own categories.

A disallowed directive is an error (500), not a silent skip.  This is the
fail-closed rule and must be preserved by the model.

## 7. Authorization evaluation

For a scope and method:

- ordinary `Require` directives form an implicit `RequireAny` list;
- an entry whose `MethodSet` does not apply is skipped;
- if every entry is skipped, the list is neutral/granted according to the
  surrounding `parent_and` context (root is granted);
- `<RequireAll>` is conjunction and requires at least one grant;
- `<RequireAny>` is disjunction;
- `<RequireNone>` cannot grant; a granted child becomes denied, a denied
  child is neutral;
- `AuthMerging And/Or` combines a child policy with the inherited policy;
- legacy `Order`/`Allow`/`Deny` is evaluated for the request method, then
  combined with the modern result by `Satisfy All|Any`.

## 8. Security invariants to prove

These are the target theorems.  The implementation should be shaped so they
are stated over pure functions.

### I1 — ACL reachability (non-bypass)

Every response path that serves a file, directory index, CGI, proxy target or
error document either:

- has called `access::check` on the effective scope with the request's
  identity and peer, and obtained `Allowed`; or
- is an explicitly documented pre-auth response (e.g. `401` challenge).

In particular, the cache lookup path may not return a stored response unless
the same check would have allowed the request.

### I1a — Resource-bound grant

The implementation refines I1 with a concrete `ResourceKey`:

```text
grant.resource = (vhost, method, URL, resolved filesystem/script path,
                  proxy/backend target, cache host/path/query,
                  opened dev/ino, policy fingerprint, identity)
cache key     = (listener address/port, scheme, grant.resource, Vary variant)
```

Every body/tunnel sink checks the grant against the resource it is about to
serve. A grant for one URL/path/proxy target/cache entry cannot be reused for
another.  Static file and directory sinks additionally bind the grant to the
opened `dev`/`inode`; if `/proc/self/fd/N` resolves to a different path (a
symlink target), policy is re-evaluated for that target path before the file
is served.  Proxy, WebSocket and FastCGI grants are bound to the exact outbound
backend/script target.  CGI scripts are bound to the opened script inode and executed via
`/proc/self/fd`; cache grants are policy-key-bound.

### I1b — Opened-object binding

For static files and directories, the grant additionally carries the opened
`(dev, inode)`.  The server resolves `/proc/self/fd/N` for the opened
descriptor; if that path differs from the URL-selected filesystem path, the
target `<Directory>`/`<Files>`/`.htaccess` scope is re-evaluated before the
response is served.  A file replaced between policy evaluation and serving is
therefore either the exact inode that was authorized or causes a 500/403.

CGI scripts are also bound to the opened `(dev, inode)`.  Bound scripts bypass
the path-based worker-pool exchange and execute through `/proc/self/fd`, so a
path replacement cannot swap the script after authorization.  Proxy,
WebSocket and FastCGI grants are additionally bound to the exact outbound
backend/script target.

### I2 — Override gating

If a directive is not permitted by the effective `AllowOverride` mode, it has
no effect on the effective scope.  If it is a security directive, the request
fails closed with 500 rather than ignoring it.

### I3 — Fast-path implication

For every request:

```
htaccess_may_apply(fs_path) == false
  ⇒ no access file in the ancestor chain changes the effective scope
```

and

```
cache prefilter says "not cacheable"
  ⇒ cache_enabled(effective_scope, raw_path) == false
```

The prefilter must be an over-approximation, never an under-approximation.
The `/cache/` trailing-slash bug was a violation of this shape.

### I4 — Conditional-last

For any scope, a conditional rule cannot be overridden by a later
Directory/Files/Location rule; condition evaluation happens after all normal
merges, including access files.

### I5 — Method limits

`MethodSet::intersect` is exact:

```
intersect(a,b).matches(m) ⇔ a.matches(m) ∧ b.matches(m)
```

and a method-limited requirement cannot apply to a method outside its set.

### I6 — Path-prefix discipline

`Location("/x/")` does not match `/x`; `Directory("/srv/foo")` does not match
`/srv/foobar`; wildcard components do not cross `/`.

### I7 — Fail-closed unsupported constructs

Unsupported access-control directives, malformed `.htaccess` files, invalid
contexts, and unknown `Require` providers deny or error; they never widen
access.

### I8 — Rewrite/proxy authorization

A proxy target reached through a rewrite `[P]` is still subject to the
matching `<Proxy>` authorization section.  `<Proxy>` matching considers both
the configured logical identity (`balancer://cluster`, or the rule URL) and
the concrete selected member, and a balancer failover re-runs that decision
before sending the request to a different member.  Prefix and regex proxy
routes form one configuration-ordered table; the first matching route chooses
HTTP proxy versus FastCGI, so a later `ProxyPassMatch` cannot reorder an
earlier `ProxyPass`.  The complete route/balancer identity rules are in I32.

### I9 — Closed-world configuration acceptance

```text
Accepted(cfg) ==> forall d in directives(cfg): handled(d) or proved_inert(d)
Strict(cfg)   ==> forall d in directives(cfg): handled(d)
```

A warning may only mean “proved semantically inert,” never “effectful but
unsupported.”  In particular, `AliasMatch`, `ScriptAliasMatch`,
`RedirectMatch`, `RedirectPermanent`, `RedirectTemp` and `RemoveHandler` are
handled; the remaining mapping/handler directives (`Action`, etc.) fail
closed in compatibility mode and strict mode rejects every unhandled name.

### I10 — One resolved target

```text
resolve(req) -> Resolved(vhost, listener, url, root, rel, fs_path,
                          script?, path_info?, backend?, cache_target?)
policy and every sink use the same Resolved
sink_grant.target == sink_target == resolve(req).target
```

The dispatcher, cache prefilter and authorization walk share `map_path()`.
`AliasMatch`/`ScriptAliasMatch` are part of that mapping, not a separate
lookup.  `map_path()` returns an explicit mapping failure when a regex alias
expands outside its configured base; there is no parent-root fallback.
`ResourceKey` carries the vhost, URL, filesystem target, proxy target, backend
identity, inode, authenticated identity and policy fingerprint; `bind_file`
and `bind_backend` produce the bound grant required by every sink.

### I11 — Reauthorize every target-changing transform

```text
Resolve -> Authorize -> [Transform -> Reauthorize]* -> Sink
Invariant: sink_grant.target == current_target
```

PATH_INFO splitting, Alias/ScriptAlias mapping, symlink resolution, internal
rewrites, DirectoryIndex, ErrorDocument and FastCGI script resolution are
transforms.  In particular:

- a CGI handler is selected from the **actual script** basename, not from a
  trailing `PATH_INFO` component;
- after `find_script`, policy is re-evaluated for the script path and the
  grant is bound to its opened inode;
- a FastCGI `ProxyPassMatch` target splits `PATH_INFO` to an existing script
  file and re-authorizes that script; the script filename and the ancestor
  walk are bounded by the configured FastCGI prefix (or the request's
  document/alias root), and symlinks that leave that base are rejected;
- an internal rewrite requires both the original request URL scope
  (`<Location>`/`<LocationMatch>`) and the final target scope to allow; the
  original URL's `Options`/`AllowOverride`/header policy is conjoined with the
  rewritten target policy, and an absolute rewrite target is only admitted
  when its canonical file remains below the current document/alias root, so a
  rewrite cannot name a new root or launder a protected upload into an
  executable directory (I61);
- an `.htaccess` walk covers every applicable ancestor of an alias or document
  root target, so parent access files outside `DocumentRoot` cannot be skipped
  (I47); the URL-selected alias root is used only for URL-base derivation
  (I48);
- `SymLinksIfOwnerMatch` compares each symlink owner with the resolved target
  owner unless unconditional `FollowSymLinks` is also enabled.

The complete transform inventory and the original/current target gate are
specified in I30.  The CGI/FastCGI execution boundary is closed in I31 and the
proxy route/balancer identity boundary in I32.

### I12 — Cache non-interference

```text
hit(entry, req) ==>
    entry.resource == resolve(req).resource
    && entry.policy == policy(resolve(req))
    && identity compatible
    && entry.vary matches req
```

The cache key binds scheme, listener local address/port, vhost, `Host`, raw
canonical URL (including trailing slash), query, resolved filesystem/alias
target and policy fingerprint.  The fingerprint includes the complete request
header set, because `Require expr`, `SetEnvIf` and rewrite conditions can read
any header, and the complete material of every `Scope` policy slice (I26);
hashing only a selected policy subset would let two tenants share an entry when
their policy branches differ.  For CGI `PATH_INFO` the resolved
target is the script prefix, not the URL-mapped nonexistent path.  Entries
also carry the configuration generation (I20); a reload makes every older
entry inadmissible.  A hit re-runs authorization against the mapped target.
Multiple `Vary` field lines are concatenated before variant selection; disk
entries must satisfy the same `vary_match` predicate as memory entries.
Unsafe methods invalidate persisted entries as well as memory entries.
Credentialed and cookie-bearing requests are not stored in the shared cache.

The per-finding closure matrix is in `docs/adversarial-closure.md`.

### I13 — Descriptor capability isolation

```text
fds(cgi_child) subseteq {0,1,2,script_fd}
control_socket.cloexec == true
```

The worker control socket is marked close-on-exec by the worker after its own
exec and before any script is spawned; the script descriptor is the only
additional inheritable descriptor.  A CGI test inspects `/proc/self/fd` and
fails if any socket other than stdio/script is visible.

### I14 — Ordered competing mappings

Every request-to-resource table has one explicit order and one deterministic
winner:

```text
Alias | ScriptAlias | AliasMatch | ScriptAliasMatch   : first match wins
Redirect | RedirectMatch | RedirectPermanent/Temp     : first match wins
ProxyPass | ProxyPassMatch                            : first match wins
AddHandler | RemoveHandler                            : last matching op wins
SetHandler                                            : precedence force
```

A later, more-specific mapping does not override an earlier overlapping one;
Apache also treats such overlapping aliases as unreachable.  For handler
operations, `RemoveHandler` must be able to cancel an inherited `AddHandler`
regardless of section depth, while `SetHandler` is a precedence force that
overrides every handler assignment in its scope regardless of order (I62,
F64).  `ProxyPass`/`ProxyPassMatch` exclusion syntax
(`!`) is not implemented and is rejected at startup rather than silently
ignored.  This closes the “multiple competing request-to-resource mappings”
class from the findings.

### I15 — Internal subrequests

```text
DirectoryIndex and local ErrorDocument dispatch go through the normal dispatcher
subrequest(req, url) retains method, headers, peer and authenticated identity
subrequest target policy is evaluated exactly like a client request
ErrorDocument recursion is depth-limited and cannot replace a failed target
```

The original directory access check happens before a `DirectoryIndex`
subrequest, and the subrequest re-checks its target.  An `ErrorDocument` may
intentionally run after a denied or missing original resource, but it still
runs through target authorization, handler selection and `.htaccess` review;
it cannot recursively invoke itself.

### I16 — Trusted input boundary

Security-relevant request context has exactly one source:

```text
scheme / HTTPS       <- listener TLS state, never a forwarding header
peer address         <- socket peer, rewritten only by configured trusted RemoteIP
canonical name       <- ServerName when UseCanonicalName On/DNS
%{SERVER_NAME}       <- dispatcher-selected name, not a raw Host lookup
vhost                <- listener port + Host/SNI selection
authorization identity <- verified Basic/client-certificate authenticator
```

`X-Forwarded-Proto`, `Forwarded`, and similar headers never satisfy `HTTPS`,
never change `REQUEST_SCHEME`, and are not authentication evidence.
Forwarded addresses are honored only for peers inside `RemoteIPInternalProxy`.
`UseCanonicalName DNS` currently maps to the configured `ServerName` rather
than performing reverse DNS; this is a conservative approximation that cannot
be steered by the client Host header.

### I17 — Bounded resource consumption

Every untrusted stream has an explicit limit and a deadline:

```text
request body + chunked trailers : byte/count/deadline bounds
CGI/FastCGI body                : spool above threshold; do not materialize LimitRequestBody
CGI output/stderr               : capped
proxy response head/body/trailer: capped
proxy chunk arithmetic          : checked_add and MAX_PROXY_BODY
handlers/descriptors            : only stdio + script fd cross exec
```

Exceeding a bound is an error response or connection close, never an
unbounded allocation or an indefinitely pinned worker.

### I18 — Response-header policy

`Header set`, `Header add`, `Header unset`, `Header always ...` and
`Header onsuccess ...` are evaluated for every response category (static,
directory, redirect, CGI/FastCGI, proxy and error).  `unset` runs after
set/add; a child `set` replaces an inherited field with the same name; `always`
fields also apply to error responses while plain/`onsuccess` fields do not.
Header names and values still pass the verified token/sanitization checks.
Unsupported `Header` actions (for example `Header edit`) are rejected at
startup rather than warned-and-ignored.

### I19 — Terminal sink gate and monotone authorization

```text
State = (original_request, current_url, current_target,
         original_grant, target_grant, cache_epoch)

forall executions:
    Terminal(state, outcome) && positive(outcome)
    ==> Allowed(original_url)
        && Allowed(current_target)
        && target_grant.target == current_target
```

A transform adds an obligation; it never replaces one.  Static, directory,
CGI, FastCGI, proxy and positive redirect outcomes all consume the gate.
In particular a rewrite chain such as `/admin -> /front -> [P] backend`
still authorizes `/admin` before the proxy sink, and a positive `[R]` after a
rewrite does the same.  The gate uses the original request context and applies
the accumulated rewrite effects, so a query-only rewrite or `[E=...]` change
cannot evade the original URL policy.  The implementation shares one
`authorize_original_request()` helper between the post-loop static path and
the early-return proxy/redirect arms; adding a new terminal outcome must route
through the same gate.  The closed transform inventory is I30.

### I20 — Cache generation and resolved-target identity

```text
CacheEntry = { epoch, resolved_target, policy_fingerprint, vary, identity }
hit(entry, req, cfg) ==>
    entry.epoch == cfg.epoch
    && entry.resolved_target == resolve(req).target
    && entry.policy_fingerprint == policy(resolve(req))
    && VaryMatches(entry, req)

Reload(cfg, cache) -> cfg', cache'
ensures cfg'.epoch = cfg.epoch + 1
        forall e in cache: e.epoch < cfg'.epoch
```

`cache_lookup_admit` takes a `generation_match` conjunct, disk metadata stores
the epoch, and reload clears both memory and persisted representations before
bumping the generation.  A CGI `PATH_INFO` request is resolved to the actual
script target (and that script's policy) for both the fingerprint and the key,
so a later `<Files "script.cgi">` deny cannot leave a usable path-info entry.
Authorization still runs on every hit; the cache is a derived view, never an
authorization shortcut.  A directory URL additionally resolves its
`DirectoryIndex` target before the cache decision; the key, target and policy
fingerprint then describe that selected file/script rather than the directory
(I49).

### I21 — Alias root identity

```text
alias_target(template, captures, server_root) -> (root, rel)
root is non-empty and absolute
mapping_root = root of the alias selected by the request URL
```

Prefix aliases and regex aliases (absolute, relative, fixed or capture-only)
must produce the same mapping root for `map_path()`, `ResourceKey`,
URL-base/`RewriteBase` derivation and the cache.  A relative substitute such
as `private/$1` is anchored at `ServerRoot` when the alias is compiled; it is
never represented as an empty root that the walk silently skips.  Per I47 the
mapping root does not bound the authorization walk.

### I22 — Contextual output encoding

```text
SafeRelativeHref = "./" + percent_encode(name)
forall name: href(autoindex, name).starts_with("./")
forall name: !is_absolute_url(href(autoindex, name))
```

HTML text escaping is not URL-context encoding.  Autoindex links, `Location`
headers, cookie values and log fields each use the encoder for their sink.
The `./` prefix removes `javascript:`, `data:`, `vbscript:` and
protocol-relative targets by construction while HTML escaping remains a
separate text-context operation.

### I23 — Provider operands and directive effects

```text
parse("Require not env NAME")   -> Env { negate: true, name: NAME }
parse("Require not env NAME=V") -> Env { negate: true, name: NAME, value: V }
parse("Require not expr E")     -> Expr { negate: true, expr: E }

Accepted(.htaccess) ==> every directive is modeled or fails closed
```

Negation shifts the operand with the provider; it does not read the literal
`env`/`expr` token.  Environment and autoindex directives are not
"accepted but inert": `SetEnv`, `SetEnvIf`, `UnsetEnv`, `PassEnv` and
`IndexIgnore` populate the same `EnvironmentPolicy`/`ContentPolicy` fields in
the main configuration and `.htaccess` parsers.  A directive that feeds
`Require env`, `Require expr`, autoindex or response policy counts as
effectful.  The exhaustive disposition registry and effect matrix for every
recognized `.htaccess` directive are specified in I29.

### I24 — Canonical directory URL and autoindex policy

```text
authorize(/dir, DirectorySlash Off) uses policy(/dir/)
IndexIgnore patterns are part of the autoindex scope
```

`/dir` and `/dir/` must share one authorization context for directory
actions.  With `DirectorySlash Off`, the dispatcher reauthorizes the
canonical trailing-slash URL before considering a directory index or
autoindex, so a trailing-slash `<Location>` cannot be bypassed.  `IndexIgnore`
patterns are inherited and filter emitted entries in both main-config and
`.htaccess` form.

### I25 — Configured-base containment

```text
configured_base(alias|rewrite|fastcgi) = the stable root named by the mapping
resolved_target(m) ∈ configured_base(m)
failure_to_prove_containment -> mapping failure (404/403), never a new root
```

An alias capture, rewrite substitution or FastCGI suffix may choose a path
inside the configured base; it may not choose the base.  `map_path()` returns
`None` for a regex alias whose expansion leaves its alias root, an internal
rewrite admits a filesystem target only below the current document/alias root,
and a FastCGI script (including its `PATH_INFO` ancestor walk) is canonicalized
inside the configured prefix or document root.  All three mapping paths consume
the verified component-aware `path_under_base` kernel, so a sibling such as
`/srv/www2` is not treated as a child of `/srv/www`.  In particular,
`UnsafePrefixStat` and compatibility flags never widen the authorization base.

### I26 — Cache authorization input closure

```text
cache_policy_material(scope) =
    canonical(scope.options, scope.override_policy, scope.authorization,
              scope.header_policy, scope.content_policy, scope.mapping_policy,
              scope.error_policy, scope.environment_policy,
              scope.rewrite_policy, scope.compression_policy,
              scope.proxy_policy)

cache_fingerprint(req) = hash(cache_policy_material(scope), peer, method,
                              resolve(req).target, all request headers)
cache_key(req)          = (listener, vhost, scheme, host, URL, query,
                           resolve(req).target, cache_fingerprint(req))
```

Any request input that can select an authorization branch or representation is
part of the key.  Header-driven providers are covered by hashing every request
header, not only the headers named in `Vary`; credentialed and cookie-bearing
requests are additionally excluded from storage.  A cached representation may
never cross a policy branch merely because the branch was selected by a header.

The policy side is closed over **every** `Scope` policy slice, not a hand-picked
subset.  `cache_policy_material` destructures `Scope`, so adding a new policy
slice is a compile-time prompt to include it.  Each policy object is hashed
through its complete `Debug` representation; rewrite maps are canonicalized by
sorting keys because their backing `HashMap` iteration order is unstable.  The
unit matrix mutates every field of every policy object and every request/key
dimension and asserts that the fingerprint or key changes.  A future policy
field is therefore either automatically bound through its policy object or
fails the matrix when someone replaces that object with a manual list.

The current authenticators are request-header based (`Authorization`), and
credentialed requests are excluded from cache lookup and storage.  If a future
authenticator derives identity from the connection rather than a header (for
example a TLS client certificate), that identity must be added to the
fingerprint before it can authorize a cacheable request.

### I27 — Authenticated identity reaches every script sink

```text
grant.identity = Some(user) -> CGI/FastCGI env contains REMOTE_USER=user
authentication scheme          -> AUTH_TYPE=Basic (for Basic authentication)
```

The identity recorded when `helper_access_response()` authenticates is carried
through the target reauthorization and grant binding into `CgiContext`.  Both
local CGI and FastCGI use the same `build_env()`, so an application cannot see
an empty user for an authenticated request.  Configured/rewrite environment
entries still cannot override `REMOTE_USER`/`AUTH_TYPE`.

### I28 — Proxy serialization boundary

```text
serialized_upstream_head = request_line + headers
forall inserted field value v: no_ctl(v) && header_value_safe(v)
backend authority ∈ DNS/IPv4/IPv6 literal alphabet
```

Backend hosts are validated when the route is parsed, `X-Forwarded-Host` is
validated before insertion, and the complete upstream request head is checked
immediately before `write_all` by the verified `proxy_request_line_admit`
(method token, visible target, exact `HTTP/1.1`) and `proxy_header_admit`
(token name, CTL-free value) kernels.
Configuration- or rewrite-derived text therefore cannot split the request line
or inject an upstream header.

### I29 — `.htaccess` directive disposition closure

```text
recognized(d) <-> exists spec(d) in DIRECTIVE_SPECS
disposition(d) in {Effectful, Inert, Reject}

Effectful(d) ==> parse(d) changes Scope or adds a rule
Inert(d)     ==> parse(d) leaves Scope unchanged
              && d cannot mutate the request, authorization, mapping,
                 handler, Options or environment state
Reject(d)    ==> parse(d) returns an error
forall recognized d: category(d) is defined
```

`DIRECTIVE_SPECS` is the authoritative registry: `directive_category()` derives
the `AllowOverride` category from it, and `apply_directive()` refuses any name
that is absent.  The exhaustive unit matrix asserts that every registry entry
has exactly one effect case, that the case matches observed behavior under
`AllowOverride All`, and that the directive is denied under `AllowOverride
None`.  Adding a directive therefore requires an explicit disposition and a
category; an accidental “recognized but silently ignored” directive fails the
test.

The reviewed inert set is `AddCharset`, `AddLanguage`, `AddEncoding`,
`RemoveCharset`, `RemoveEncoding`, `AddDescription`, `IndexOptions`,
`ReadmeName` and `HeaderName`, plus the validated no-op
`AuthBasicProvider file`.  These do not select an access or mapping branch.
`RequestHeader` and `AllowMethods` are `Reject`; they are never inert.

### I30 — Transform inventory and reauthorization gate

```text
Transform = (original_request, before_url, before_target,
             after_url, after_target, effects)

forall terminal positive outcomes after a transform:
    Allowed(original_request, original_url, original_target)
    && Allowed(current_request, current_url, current_target)
    && grant.target == current_target
    && grant is bound to the current inode/backend/cache key
```

A transform adds an authorization obligation; it never replaces one.  The
final target policy is likewise a meet with the URL policy, never a
replacement (I61).  The inventory is closed over every request-to-resource
conversion:

| Transform | Target identity | Reauthorization / binding |
|---|---|---|
| prefix alias, `ScriptAlias` | `map_path` root + rel | target scope, alias-root access walk, file grant |
| `AliasMatch`, `ScriptAliasMatch` | capture-expanded target inside stable alias base | mapping failure outside base; target scope, file grant |
| internal URL rewrite | canonical rewritten URL | target scope + original-URL gate with rewrite effects; original and target policy meet (I61) |
| internal filesystem rewrite | canonical file below current root | target scope + rewritten URL scope meet, original-URL gate, file inode grant |
| CGI `PATH_INFO` | `find_script_checked` actual script | script scope, inode-bound CGI grant |
| FastCGI `ProxyPassMatch`/`PATH_INFO` | contained script filename + `PATH_INFO` | script scope, backend-bound FastCGI grant |
| `SetHandler proxy:fcgi` | contained handler script | script scope, backend-bound FastCGI grant |
| symlink resolution | opened descriptor path | target scope, file inode grant |
| `DirectoryIndex` | index subrequest URL | normal dispatcher authorization for the index target |
| local `ErrorDocument` | error-document subrequest URL | normal dispatcher authorization; recursion bound |
| `DirectorySlash Off` | canonical trailing-slash URL | reauthorize before index/autoindex |
| proxy route / balancer failover | concrete member URL + binding | `<Proxy>` reauthorization, backend-bound proxy grant |
| cache `PATH_INFO` | actual CGI script target | cache policy grant bound to script target |
| WebSocket rewrite/proxy | rewritten proxy target | rewrite gate, proxy authorization, backend binding |

The original-URL gate deliberately uses the **original request context** and
applies the accumulated rewrite effects before evaluating the original scope.
A rewrite that changes only the query string or only `[E=...]` environment
state therefore still rechecks the original URL policy; it cannot use the
rewritten query or environment to escape it.  The final target scope uses the
current rewritten request context.

### I31 — CGI/FastCGI execution boundary

```text
script = resolve_script(req)
contained(script, configured_base)
authorized(script, target_scope) && identity(grant) == identity(req)
CGI:     grant bound to opened script inode
FastCGI: grant bound to (transport, script, SCRIPT_NAME, PATH_INFO)
env = calculated_env(req, script) ∪ admitted(config/rewrite env)
calculated_env ∩ admitted_env = ∅
fds(child) subseteq {0,1,2,script_fd}
FastCGI params contain exactly one SCRIPT_FILENAME, SCRIPT_NAME,
PATH_INFO and PATH_TRANSLATED for the selected target
```

The handler is selected from the **actual script basename**, never from a
trailing `PATH_INFO` component.  Script construction, `PATH_INFO` splitting
and the ancestor walk are bounded by the configured FastCGI prefix or the
document/alias root; symlink escapes are rejected.  The target script is
reauthorized before execution and the grant is bound to its inode (CGI) or
transport/script identity (FastCGI).  `REMOTE_USER`/`AUTH_TYPE` come from the
authenticated grant, while configured or rewrite-set environment entries
cannot override calculated names.  Request bodies stay on their spool file
above the threshold; stdout/stderr, descriptors and deadlines are bounded.

### I32 — Proxy route and balancer identity

```text
Route = (order, matcher, logical_identity, concrete_member)
selected = matching route with minimum order
prefix and regex routes share one order space

balancer request has:
    logical_identity  = balancer://name/suffix or rule URL
    concrete_identity = selected member URL + binding_key

authorize(logical_identity) && authorize(concrete_identity)
failover(member') -> (scope', grant', resource') atomically
sink_grant.target == selected_member.binding_key()
```

Prefix and regex `ProxyPass`/`ProxyPassMatch` routes form one
configuration-ordered table; a later overlapping route cannot beat an earlier
one.  `<Proxy>`/`<ProxyMatch>` policy is applied to both the logical balancer
identity and the concrete selected member.  Sticky sessions, health checks and
round-robin only choose a member; they never bypass authorization.  On
failover the dispatcher re-runs proxy authorization, rebuilds the resource key
for the new member and binds a new grant to that member before sending.  The
selected grant/resource pair is replaced together, so a grant for member A
cannot authorize a request sent to member B.

### I33 — Framing and resource-bounds closure

```text
forall untrusted stream s:
    bytes(s) <= bound(s)
    && deadline(s) is finite
    && overflow is checked before resize/allocation
```

The bound is part of the protocol adapter, not an incidental `Vec` limit:

| Stream | Explicit bound |
|---|---|
| HTTP/1 request line/head | `LimitRequestLine`, `LimitRequestFields`, `LimitRequestFieldSize`, total head cap |
| HTTP/1 request body | `LimitRequestBody`, in-memory threshold then an `O_EXCL`, mode-0600 spool file that is unlinked immediately |
| HTTP/1 chunked trailers | trailer count and byte budget, request deadline |
| Proxy response head | line, header-count and total-head caps |
| Proxy response body | fixed-length/chunked/EOF body capped at `MAX_PROXY_BODY`; chunk `checked_add` before resize |
| Proxy trailers | trailer count and byte budget |
| CGI worker protocol | path/env/body field caps, env-count cap, body spool above threshold |
| CGI stdout/stderr | output and stderr caps, watchdog deadline, process-group kill |
| FastCGI records | fixed record/header sizes; stdout spool cap; stderr cap |
| FastCGI response head | bounded prefix/header scan before body streaming |
| HTTP/1 response framing | the writer discards caller `Content-Length`/`Transfer-Encoding`, emits the computed length, and treats a short file body as a connection-closing error |
| HTTP/2 | verified settings, header-state, flow-control, body and reset budgets |
| Compression | fixed maximum compressible body; range/HEAD bypass |

A malformed or over-limit stream produces an error response or connection
close; it never causes an unbounded allocation or an indefinitely pinned
worker.

### I34 — Main-configuration directive disposition closure

```text
recognized(d) -> handled(d) | fail_closed(d) | warned_inert(d)
security(d) || filter(d) || audit(d) || resource_bound(d) -> fail_closed(d)
warned_inert(d) -> d is presentation/module-absence only
Strict(cfg) -> forall unhandled d: reject(cfg)
```

`fail_closed_directives` and the security-family classifier are the explicit
main-config counterpart of the `.htaccess` registry.  Security, filter, audit
and resource-limit directives that are not implemented fail startup even in
compatibility mode.  The remaining compatibility warnings are limited to a
reviewed presentation/module-absence surface (for example `AddDescription`,
`UserDir`, `Session*`, `Substitute`, `Charset*`); strict mode rejects every
unhandled directive.  The disposition matrix test asserts the fail-closed set,
the explicit warning set and strict-mode rejection.

### I35 — Single-file alias target split

```text
prefix_alias(target is file) -> (root = target.parent, rel = target.file_name)
prefix_alias(target is directory) -> (root = target, rel = URL remainder)
```

A file target never produces an empty `rel`.  The basename is what carries the
handler/MIME extension and `SCRIPT_FILENAME`; treating the file as a root hid
the extension and served scripts as static source (F39).  The split obligation
is mechanized as `alias_file_target_split`.

### I36 — Single-file alias access root

```text
mapping_root(alias target) == target             if target is a directory
mapping_root(alias target) == target.parent      otherwise
```

The URL/base root for a file target is its parent directory.  Returning the
file itself broke URL-base derivation and handler identity (F39).  This root
is not an authorization boundary: per I47 the access-file walk covers every
applicable ancestor regardless of the alias target.  `alias_access_root_admit`
states the file case.

### I37 — Handler selection from the resolved target

```text
handler/MIME/FastCGI selection consumes resolve(req).target.file_name
```

The URL remainder or lexical alias name may not reclassify a resolved script
as static.  `handler_name_from_target` is the mechanized predicate; the
dispatcher passes the resolved basename to `effective_handler`,
`cgi::is_cgi`, `mime_type` and FastCGI handler selection.

### I38 — `<Limit>` directive effect

```text
accepted_in_limit(d) && effectful(d) -> applied(d) or rejected(d)
not (accepted_in_limit(d) && effectful(d) && ignored(d))
```

Apache applies `Options`, `Header`, `AddHandler` and `SetHandler` written
inside `<Limit>`; discarding them let `Options -ExecCGI` become a
remote-execution bypass (F40).  Main-configuration directives inside a
method-limited section are now applied to the enclosing scope, and auth/access
directives still consume the method set.  `.htaccess` continues to reject
non-auth directives in `<Limit>`.  `limit_directive_effect` is the verified
disposition predicate.

### I39 — CGI/FastCGI actual-target policy

```text
actual_target != lexical_target ->
    authorize(actual_target) && bind(actual_target) before execute/forward
```

CGI and FastCGI dispatch re-authorize the opened or canonicalized target and
bind the sink to it before execution or before sending `SCRIPT_FILENAME`.  This
includes `PATH_INFO`, `SetHandler` and `ProxyPassMatch` routes; a public
symlink cannot inherit the allowed directory's policy (F41).
`cgi_actual_target_admit` is the mechanized implication.

### I40 — Capture-only regex alias base

```text
replacement has leading capture and no stable prefix -> no base
no base -> map_path returns None
```

An `AliasMatch`/`ScriptAliasMatch` replacement such as `"$1"` has no implicit
`ServerRoot` base.  Falling back to `ServerRoot` admitted arbitrary reads of
`.htpasswd`, keys and configuration (F42).  Only an explicit directory prefix
(`/srv/private/$1`, `private/$1`) creates a base;
`capture_only_alias_admit` is the verified decision.

### I41 — Exclusive private temporary files

```text
temp_file_create -> create_new && private_mode && unlink_after_open
```

The FastCGI output spool uses `create_new` (`O_EXCL`), mode `0600`, a bounded
collision retry and immediate unlink.  A pre-created shared-temp symlink can
neither redirect nor truncate a server-writable file (F43).
`temp_file_create_admit` states the exclusive/private conjunction.

### I42 — Expression file-test confinement

```text
expr_file_test(arg) -> !absolute(arg)
                     && !parent_relative(arg)
                     && canonical(arg) under canonical(DocumentRoot)
```

`-f`, `-d`, `-e`, `-s`, `-F` and `-U` use the same confinement as
`file()`/`filesize()`; `<IfFile>` remains the explicit main-configuration
exception because its argument is operator supplied.  Without this, a writable
`.htaccess` could use absolute paths or escaping symlinks as a metadata oracle
(F45).  `expr_file_test_admit` is consumed by `confined_expr_path`.

### I43 — Multi-provider `<RequireNone>`

```text
RequireNone(children) -> deny    if any child is Granted
                      -> neutral if no child is Granted
RequireNone(children) never grants
```

The children are aggregated as an OR of positive hits before the negation is
applied.  Combining the children with AND let a denied sibling neutralize a
granted child, turning a multi-network block list into an allow list (F46).
`combine_or_all`, `require_none_multi` and `require_none_multi_result` are the
mechanized aggregation/negation kernels consumed by `access.rs`.

### I44 — Regex alias file target

```text
regex_alias(target is file) -> (root = target.parent, rel = target.basename)
access_root(alias target) == target.parent if target is not a directory
```

A regex replacement ending in `/` may still name a regular file.  The target
must be split exactly like a prefix file alias, whether or not the replacement
had a trailing slash (F47).  The regex mapping branch consumes
`alias_file_target_split`, and the URL/base root uses the file's parent via
`alias_access_root_admit`.  Ancestor authorization still follows I47, so the
mapping-root choice cannot hide a parent access file.

### I45 — Destination-address virtual-host selection

```text
select_vhost(destination, port, Host):
    address_bound(vhost) && destination != vhost.address -> not a candidate
    exact_address_vhost_present -> wildcard vhost cannot take precedence
```

Apache groups virtual hosts by destination address and port.  A loopback-bound
administrative vhost is therefore not reachable through a public address even
when the client supplies its `Host` name, and an exact-address vhost wins over
a wildcard vhost on that address (F48).  `vhost_address_admit` and
`vhost_address_precedence` are consumed by `Config::select_vhost` and the TLS
vhost filter when a listener has a concrete destination address; HTTP/1.1,
HTTP/2, WebSocket, cache and logging call sites all pass the connection's local
address.

### I46 — Canonical peer identity

```text
peer ::ffff:a.b.c.d  ==  peer a.b.c.d
```

IPv4-mapped IPv6 peers on dual-stack listeners are canonicalized before any
authorization, logging, cache or CGI identity decision.  An IPv4
`Require ip`/`Require not ip` network therefore sees the IPv4 client, and
`Require local` treats `::ffff:127.0.0.1` as loopback (F49).
`ipv4_mapped_to_v4` is the verified conversion consumed by
`access::canonical_ip`; the connection boundary and RemoteIP path apply it
before the request context is built.

### I47 — Access walk domain

```text
dir in access_walk(target)  <==>  dir is an ancestor of target
                                  && effective_override(dir) permits access files
DocumentRoot(target) and alias_root(target) are not lower bounds
```

Apache consults `.htaccess` at every ancestor directory for which its
`<Directory>`/`AllowOverride` policy permits overrides.  A `DocumentRoot` or
alias target is a URL-mapping label only; using it as the walk boundary
silently discarded policies in an application root above `public/` or in a
parent of an alias target (F50).  The runtime walk consumes
`access_walk_dir_admit`, and `access_file_layer_read` no longer contains an
`under_root` conjunct.  URL-base/`RewriteBase` derivation still receives the
root selected by `map_path()`, but that root never decides participation.

### I48 — URL-selected alias mapping root

```text
alias_root(req) == root returned by map_path(req.url)
alias_root(req) != first alias target that happens to contain resolve(req)
```

An ordered alias table is selected by URL prefix or regex, not by filesystem
containment.  Overlapping targets can therefore make “the first alias whose
target contains the path” a different alias from the one that mapped the
request.  `map_path()` returns the actual mapping root, and every caller passes
that value to the access walk/cache; `alias_mapping_root_admit` states that a
root inferred from alias-target containment is never admitted (F51).  The
mapping root selects the alias for `ResourceKey` and containment, while
per-directory URL bases follow the URL mount for layers at/below it (I50) and
the rewrite matching subject is filesystem-relative for every layer (I58),
never a path relative to the alias target alone.  Authorization still walks
every ancestor per I47.

### I49 — DirectoryIndex cache target

```text
CacheKey(req for /dir/) binds selected_index(target)
CacheFingerprint(req for /dir/) binds selected_index(target).policy
dynamic(selected_index) && CacheIgnoreQueryString && query != "" -> no cache
```

A directory URL resolves through `DirectoryIndex` to a different file or
script before dispatch.  The cache decision must therefore resolve the index
first and bind the key, target, authorization grant and policy fingerprint to
that selected index.  `CacheIgnoreQueryString` may never merge a dynamic
index/script representation across queries, and a live `<Files>`/`.htaccess`
change affecting the index must change the computed policy before a lookup
(F52).  The runtime consumes `cache_directory_index_bind_admit` and
`cache_ignore_query_admit` before lookup/store.

### I50 — Per-directory rewrite URL base

```text
layer_dir at/below mapping_root
depth(layer_dir, target_dir) == number of filesystem components below layer_dir
match_base(layer) == URL_path(target)[0 .. len - depth] with a trailing slash
match_base(layer) != path(layer_dir) relative to an alias target
```

For a layer at or below the URL-mapping root, Apache's per-directory rewrite
prefix is the URL mount, not the directory's position under the alias target.
Using the target-relative path made `RewriteRule ^private/ - [F]` miss and
served or executed protected files (F53).  `request_plan::layer_url_mount()`
is now the single derivation used by access files and main-configuration
`<Directory>` rules; `RewriteBase` remains the substitution base only.  The
runtime consumes `htaccess_layer_url_base_admit`.  Matching subject identity is
separate and follows I58 for every layer, including layers above the mapping
root.

### I57 — REQUEST_URI identity

```text
every expression/rewrite/environment evaluation of %{REQUEST_URI}
  == dispatcher.canonical_url_path
canonical_url_path is percent-decoded, dot-segment-normalized, and query-free
%{REQUEST_URI} != Request::target (raw request-line bytes)
%{REQUEST_URI} does not include %{QUERY_STRING}
```

`Require expr`, `<If>`, `SetEnvIf Request_URI`, `RewriteCond` and rewrite
substitution expansion all inspect the same canonical URL path that dispatch
uses to select the filesystem target.  Binding any of them to the raw request
target let a query suffix, percent encoding or dot segment make a deny
expression miss or an allow expression match the wrong resource (F57).  The
runtime passes the dispatcher path into `expr::Context`,
`Scope::request_env`, `access::check` and `rewrite::Context`; the CGI
`REQUEST_URI` is likewise the canonical script URL.  `expr::Context::new`
consumes `request_uri_identity_admit`, and no implementation appends the query
string.

### I58 — Access-file rewrite subject above the mapping root

```text
for an access-file layer D:
subject(rule, request) == target_path relative to D
subject(rule, request) == requested filesystem target with D's prefix removed
subject(rule, request) != URL_path with components stripped by filesystem depth
layer above mapping_root -> subject is still filesystem-relative
cannot construct subject -> layer fails closed, never silently non-matching
```

Apache's per-directory `RewriteRule` pattern sees `r->filename` relative to the
access-file directory, not a URL prefix.  Layers above an alias/document-root
mapping root can therefore have a subject such as `wallet/public/.env` even
though the request URL is `/wallet/.env`; layers under a fixed `AliasMatch`
suffix can be deeper than the URL.  The runtime attaches the layer directory to
every parsed access-file rule, computes the subject with the single
`request_plan::layer_subject()` implementation, and consumes
`htaccess_rewrite_subject_admit` before matching.  If the subject cannot be
derived, dispatch fails closed instead of skipping the layer's deny rules
(F58).  `request_plan::layer_url_mount()` is only the relative-substitution
base; for layers above the mapping root it uses Apache's filesystem-directory
form rather than the old unmatchable URL fallback.

### I59 — Single request-plan identity

```text
dispatch(cache lookup/store) and --explain consume one RequestPlan
RequestPlan.canonical_url_path == CanonicalTarget.url_path
RequestPlan.mapping_root/rel/fs_path == map_path(canonical target)
RequestPlan.layers == access-file walk(cfg, fs_path, canonical_url_path)
rewrite Context(plan) uses plan.url_path/fs_path/mapping_root
```

Cache and dispatch previously re-decoded `Request::raw_path` and rebuilt the
mapping independently.  They now receive the same `RequestPlan`, so a cache
decision cannot be based on a different URI spelling, mapping root or
access-file layer set than the request that is eventually served.  Rewrite
rounds build a new plan from the rewritten canonical URL, and that plan is the
input to the next scope evaluation.  `--explain` prints the plan’s canonical
path, mapping, layer directories, URL mounts and filesystem subjects.

### I60 — Explicit-target access-layer binding

```text
for every RequestPlan built from an explicit target T:
  layer_walk_root == T
  for every collected layer L: T == L.dir or T is beneath L.dir
  mapping_root may differ from T only as a URL/RewriteBase label
  nonempty RequestPlan.layers are always consumed by scope evaluation
  mapping_root containing a symlink must not fabricate root.join(file_name)
fail closed if the layer set does not belong to T
```

The initial URL-mapped plan and a later canonical-target plan have two path
identities.  A plan built from an explicit target must derive its access-file
walk, layer identities and scope evaluation from that same target; the
mapping root is allowed to differ because it names the URL mount (and may be a
symlink such as a release `current` link).  A failed `strip_prefix(root, T)`
is not evidence that `T` has no access files: the walk uses `T`'s real
ancestors, inheriting `AllowOverride` policy from the corresponding lexical
mapping directory when the root itself is symlinked.  `from_fs_target`,
`build_with_fs_path`, `evaluate_scope` and the `cache`/`DirectoryIndex`
target paths consume `explicit_target_layer_admit` and
`target_layer_consume_admit`; a nonempty layer set is never silently replaced
by the configuration-only scope (F59).

### I61 — Resolved-target and rewrite scope conjunction

```text
L = URL-mapped lexical path/scope
T = opened/canonical target path/scope (or the rewritten URL target)
L != T  ==>  effective_scope = meet(scope(L), scope(T))
options_effective(L, T)    == options(L) AND options(T)
handler(L, ext) == handler(T, ext)  -> permitted
otherwise                            -> no handler (source/default)
AllowOverride(L) None  ==> no access-file layer of T is read
every transform target (symlink, alias, rewrite, PATH_INFO, FastCGI,
DirectoryIndex, DirectorySlash, cache target) uses the same meet
rewrite changes the URL ==> original URL policy is retained as well
```

The URL identity and the resolved filesystem identity can differ without any
URI normalizer, `openat2` or inode-binding failure: a symlinked `DocumentRoot`
or alias, an in-root symlink created by upload/archive extraction, a
`DirectoryIndex`, or a rewrite-selected target all produce two policy
identities.  Replacing `scope(L)` with `scope(T)` dropped child
`<Directory>` and ancestor `.htaccess` restrictions, so `Options -ExecCGI`,
`Options -Indexes`, `RemoveHandler` and lexical `AllowOverride None` were
bypassed (F60).  `Scope::restrict_with()` now computes the meet:
`options_conjoin`, `handler_conjoin_admit` and
`override_categories_conjoin` are the verified kernels; handler maps are
projected to explicit per-extension grants only when both identities agree,
and an explicit lexical `SetHandler none` materializes as a static
`none` force across the meet (F64b: the resolved target cannot re-arm an
extension handler the lexical identity unforced).
The `AllowOverride` walk consumes `OverridePolicy::conjoined_with()` so an
explicit `None` on either path identity denies the canonical access file,
while an unconfigured canonical directory does not erase an enabled lexical
policy (the F59 shape).  Rewrite-selected filesystem targets and cache targets
use the same meet; the post-rewrite original-URL gate uses
`restrict_policy_with()` so it retains the original `Options`/headers without
forcing the old filename's handler extension onto a legitimately rewritten
target.

### I62 — SetHandler precedence

```text
SetHandler in scope S forces handler H for every request S governs
effective_handler == forced-name            when S forces a name
effective_handler == ext-table resolution   when S forces none
merging/inheritance never re-parses the force into the extension table
the extension table can neither add nor remove execution past a force
```

`SetHandler` is a precedence field (`MappingPolicy.set_handler`), not an
extension-table entry, so directive order and inheritance cannot re-prioritize
it (F64).  `effective_handler` consults the force first; a child `SetHandler
none` clears the parent force and the extension table applies again (the
Apache 2.4.69 probes).  The conjoin across the resolved-target meet keeps
`set_handler_conjoin_admit` and materializes a lexical denial as a static
force, so the attacker `.htaccess` `AddHandler` upload chain (F64b) is dead.
`[H=...]` rewrites write the same field.  `set_handler_precedence_admit` is
the kernel; `set_handler_conjoin_preserves_force` proves the conjoin never
grants.

### I63 — Expression filesystem variables fail closed

```text
%{REQUEST_FILENAME}/%{SCRIPT_FILENAME} == mapped fs_path  when bound
unbound reference -> Err (fail closed), never an empty string
unknown variable -> configuration error at load time
```

The `<If>`/`Require expr`/`RewriteCond expr` idioms that key on the mapped
filesystem path must evaluate against the dispatcher's canonical mapping
(F63/F63b).  `expr::Context::fs_path` is the only binding; without one the
variables fail closed instead of substituting an empty string that would
make a guard silently take the attacker's direction.  `expr_var_known` is the
single source of truth shared by evaluation and the load-time `validate_vars`
walker (which also scans `%{...}` inside `Expr::Str` and transform arguments),
so an unknown variable is a configuration error, never an inert string.

### I66 — CGI execution admission

```text
execute(script) <=> classified && exec_allowed
classified   == handler-bound ? (handler == cgi-script) : script_alias
exec_allowed == script_alias || Options ExecCGI
```

CGI execution requires both a CGI classification and a filesystem grant
(F65/I66).  `cgi::is_cgi` reduces to the single verified kernel
`cgi_exec_admit`, so a `SetHandler default-handler` force inside a
`ScriptAlias` tree serves static source (Apache behavior), while the ScriptAlias
mapping keeps executing scripts with `Options` disabled — the Apache 2.4.69
matrix.  `cgi_exec_requires_cgi_handler` and `cgi_exec_requires_exec_allowed`
prove the fail-closed direction.

### I70 — Lexical handler identity

```text
handler/MIME classification binds to the request-mapped basename
L != T  ==>  the canonical target's basename must not classify the request
```

The handler for a request is derived from the lexical URL-mapped filename,
not from the canonicalized target (F69/I70): an in-root symlink
`link.txt -> secret.cgi` under a global `AddHandler cgi-script .cgi` must
serve static source, exactly as Apache does.  Authorization and containment
still bind to the resolved target.  `handler_identity_lexical_admit` is the
kernel guard at the dispatch binding.

### I51 — Cache key byte identity

```text
base_key(req) == base_key(req')
  ==> listener, vhost, host, raw URL path, raw query, resolved target bytes
      and policy fingerprint are identical as byte strings
```

A cache key must be injective over the raw bytes that select an entry.
`String::from_utf8_lossy` and `Path::display()` can map distinct invalid-byte
queries, paths or targets to the same replacement text.  `cache_key_hex`
encodes every byte component as two ASCII hex digits; paths that are not valid
UTF-8 bypass the shared cache, and invalidation uses the same encoding.  The
Verus refinement proves the runtime encoder equals `cache_key_hex_spec`, and
`cache_key_hex_spec_injective` proves the encoding is injective over raw byte
sequences, not merely length-preserving.  This closes the
invalid-query/clean-URL collision (F55) for query, path and target material.
Policy/request identity is a separate 256-bit value: every exact material
field is framed by the verified, injective `cache_fingerprint_field` and
hashed with SHA-256.  The old 64-bit `DefaultHasher` fingerprint was small
enough for a header-varying attacker to target; SHA-256 collision resistance
remains a cryptographic assumption, not a Verus theorem.

### I52 — ErrorDocument cache scope

```text
missing(target) && scope.selects_local_error_document
  -> no cache lookup or store for the missing URL
response.from_local_error_document -> no store under the original URL
```

A local `ErrorDocument` is an internal subrequest selected only after dispatch
fails.  Its effective handler, target, query handling and live `.htaccess`
policy belong to the error target, not the missing URL.  Binding the outer
request to the internal subrequest's response would let a query-dependent or
dynamic error document poison the missing URL's entry (F56).  The runtime
consumes `cache_local_error_document_admit` at lookup for a missing target and
again at store using the subrequest's response-provenance marker; the internal
dispatch itself still runs the normal authorization and handler chain.  Existing
targets keep normal cache behavior even when the scope defines an error
document.

### I53 — Dynamic handler classification

```text
effective_handler(target) != default-handler
  -> dynamic(target)
dynamic(target) && CacheIgnoreQueryString && query != "" -> no cache
```

`CacheIgnoreQueryString` may only merge representations whose target is a
static default handler.  The classifier consumes the effective handler after
`DirectoryIndex` resolution and covers `SetHandler "proxy:…|fcgi://…"`,
`cgi-script`, `server-status` and future non-default handlers, not just
`ProxyPass` routes.  The runtime consumes `cache_dynamic_handler_admit` before
`cache_ignore_query_admit`, closing the FastCGI `SetHandler` query leak (F54).

### I54 — Cache store admission

```text
store(req, resp) ==> req.method == GET && req.body == empty
                    && no Authorization/Cookie
                    && status in {200,203,300,301,308,404,410}
                    && Cache-Control permits storage
                    && no Set-Cookie && Vary != *
                    && min_file_size <= body <= max_file_size
                    && freshness_ttl > 0
```

A representation enters the shared cache only through these gates.  The
runtime consumes `cache_store_request_admit`, `cache_store_status_admit`,
`cache_store_control_admit`, `cache_store_shape_admit` and
`cache_store_ttl_admit` instead of an unverified chain of early returns.
Freshness values pass through `cache_ttl_clamp`, which returns zero for a
reversed `CacheMinExpire`/`CacheMaxExpire` pair rather than panicking, and
expiry uses the verified saturating `cache_expiry`, so a positive TTL can never
wrap into the past.  Disk accounting consumes `cache_disk_projected` and
`cache_disk_evict`; eviction steps are proven not to increase projected usage.
Policy binding uses `cache_fingerprint_field`, whose length framing is proven
injective. V4 disk metadata stores the complete framed base key; lookup admits
an entry only when that metadata key exactly matches the requested key, while
the SHA-1 filename is treated only as an index. Unsafe-method invalidation uses
the same canonical request/selected-representation identity and removes only
entries admitted by the verified key-prefix predicate.

## 9. Formalization boundary

The first Verus model should cover:

1. `merge_scope` and the per-field merge functions
2. `rule_matches` for Directory/Files/Location and glob patterns
3. `apply_phase` / `effective_scope` over an abstract rule list
4. `eval_require` over `AuthPolicy`, `MethodSet`, `AuthMerging`
5. `override_allowed` and the category table
6. `cache_maybe_enabled` and `htaccess_may_apply` prefilter predicates
7. ordered mapping-table resolution (alias/redirect/proxy/handler operations)
8. transform-state reauthorization and sink-grant identity
9. subrequest identity and error-document recursion bounds
10. trusted request-context construction (scheme, peer, canonical name)
11. response-header policy application and merge
12. configured-base containment for alias, rewrite and FastCGI mappings
13. cache-key input closure over policy-relevant request headers
14. `.htaccess` directive disposition closure and override-category coverage
15. transform inventory closure and original/current target reauthorization
16. CGI/FastCGI script, environment, descriptor and identity closure
17. proxy route ordering plus logical/concrete balancer identity binding
18. framing and resource-bound closure over every untrusted stream
19. main-config directive disposition closure and strict-mode rejection

The following remain assumptions or separate proofs:

- the regex engine implements the stated language;
- the filesystem contents match what the access-file walk sees;
- path canonicalization and `openat` containment (already separately
  verified in `crates/verified`);
- h2 wire framing and TLS/CGI/proxy protocol code;
- configuration parsing itself (the parser must produce a model accepted by
  the proofs; a parser proof can follow).

## 10. Proof obligations / lemmas

Suggested order:

1. `merge_assoc` where fields are associative, and explicit counterexamples
   for fields that are not (e.g. `Options Set`).
2. `phase_order`: folding phases in `Directory < Files < Location <
   Condition` order is equivalent to the reference interpreter.
3. `htaccess_interleave`: the per-directory fold matches the reference
   sequence `Directory, access-file` at each level.
4. `require_eval_sound`: `eval_policy` returns `Allowed` only if the policy
   actually grants under the provider semantics.
5. `require_none_never_grants`: a `<RequireNone>` subtree cannot produce a
   grant by itself.
6. `override_gate`: if `allowed(mode, directive) == false`, applying the
   directive leaves the scope unchanged (or produces the error result).
7. `prefilter_sound`: fast-path predicates imply the authoritative checks.
8. `acl_reachability`: every dispatch branch that returns a file/proxy body
   has a predecessor `check(scope, req) == Allowed`.
9. `configured_base_containment`: alias, rewrite and FastCGI resolution never
   returns a target outside the mapping's stable base, and a failed
   containment check produces no target.
10. `cache_input_closure`: the cache key contains every request input read by
    authorization, environment and rewrite evaluation.
11. `identity_propagation`: an authenticated grant's identity is present in
    the CGI/FastCGI environment at the script sink.
12. `proxy_head_safe`: every serialized upstream request line and header value
    satisfies the token/header predicates before I/O.

## 10a. Mechanized pieces already connected

`crates/server/src/policy_ref.rs` is the single pure evaluator for the
configuration phases **and** for access-file layers.  The walker only parses
`.htaccess` files into `AccessLayer` values; `effective_scope_with_layers`
performs the interleaving.  Production dispatch, cache and websocket paths
call this evaluator, so configuration/access-file ordering equivalence is by
construction: there is no second production interleaver.

`crates/verified` now reports **268 verified functions, 0 errors**.  The following pieces are Verus-checked; items marked model-only await a runtime projection/refinement:

- `PolicyResult`, `combine_and`, `combine_or`, `combine_or_all`,
  `require_none_result`, `require_none_multi`, `require_none_multi_result`.
  `crates/server/src/access.rs` calls these for
  `<RequireAll>`/`<RequireAny>`/`<RequireNone>`; the multi-provider
  `<RequireNone>` path aggregates positive hits with OR before negation.
- `ipv4_mapped_to_v4`, consumed by `access::canonical_ip` at the connection
  and RemoteIP boundaries; `vhost_address_admit` and
  `vhost_address_precedence`, consumed by `Config::select_vhost` and the TLS
  vhost filter.
- `AccessStep`, `access_walk_plan`, `access_plan`, `access_plan_exec`.
  `policy_ref::effective_scope_with_layers` iterates the verified plan.  The
  plan has one `Walk { access }` step per ancestor directory, with the
  per-directory `Directory; access-scope` interleaving inside that step, then
  the exact suffix `DirectoryMatch, ConfigFiles, AccessFiles, Location,
  config If, access If`.  `access_plan_interleaves` proves one step per
  directory, every walk before the suffix, and the suffix shape.
- `auth_merge_kind`.  `Scope::merge` uses this three-way verified decision
  (`Replace`/`And`/`Or`) before constructing the authorization tree.
  `auth_merge_kind_properties` proves that `And`/`Or` are impossible without
  an inherited parent policy.
- `option_child_wins` / `option_child_presence`.  Scalar and
  clone-based optional security fields in `Scope::merge` use verified
  child-wins combinators.  Presence is proved exact; the underlying clone is a
  standard-library primitive.
- `append_vec`, `merge_containers`, `container_append_preserves_parent`,
  `container_lookup_pair` and `container_append_child_lookup_wins`.  Every
  append-only container/list field in `Scope::merge` appends through the
  verified `append_vec` helper, including list-backed `ErrorDocument` and
  `RewriteMap` fields.  `Header set` uses ordered child replacement (the
  runtime debug snapshot audit models that replacement separately).  Child values win by reverse lookup.  Debug builds still audit the
  concrete `Scope` containers after every merge against a projected snapshot
  and fail if a field is omitted or reordered.
- `options_apply`.  `Scope::effective_options` uses the verified
  Set/Add/Remove operation instead of an open-coded match.
- `expr_value_truthy`, `expr_compare_ints`, `expr_compare_strs`,
  `expr_glob_match` and `cond_chain_eval`.  Expression values map to booleans
  through the verified truthiness table; integer and UTF-8 byte-string
  comparisons, `-strmatch`/`-fnmatch` globbing and rewrite `[OR]` condition
  groups all consume verified kernels.  Leaf evaluators that consult regex,
  filesystem, IP or request state remain explicit assumptions.
- `path_under_base`, `rewrite_filesystem_admit`, `proxy_request_line_admit`
  and `proxy_header_admit`.  Alias, rewrite and FastCGI targets use the
  component-aware containment predicate (`/srv/www2` is not below `/srv/www`);
  the proxy serializer admits the outbound method, target, version and every
  header through the same token/header predicates immediately before
  `write_all`.
- `alias_file_target_split`, `alias_access_root_admit`,
  `handler_name_from_target`, `limit_directive_effect`,
  `cgi_actual_target_admit`, `capture_only_alias_admit`,
  `temp_file_create_admit`, `cache_disk_size_admit` and
  `expr_file_test_admit`.  These are the pass-4 disposition predicates for
  single-file aliases, `<Limit>` effects, actual-target handler
  reauthorization, capture-only aliases, exclusive spool creation, disk-cache
  quota and expression file-test confinement (I35–I42).  `confined_expr_path`
  consumes `expr_file_test_admit`; the remaining predicates document and
  mechanize the runtime branches exercised by the F39–F45 replay suite.
- `combine_or_all`, `require_none_multi`, `require_none_multi_result`,
  `vhost_address_admit`, `vhost_address_precedence` and
  `ipv4_mapped_to_v4`.  These are the pass-5 kernels for multi-provider
  `<RequireNone>` (I43), regex alias file targets (I44, sharing the pass-4
  split predicates), destination-address virtual-host eligibility (I45) and
  canonical IPv4-mapped peer identity (I46).  `access::eval_node`,
  `Config::select_vhost`, the TLS vhost filter and `access::canonical_ip`
  consume them directly.
- `access_walk_dir_admit`, `alias_mapping_root_admit`,
  `cache_directory_index_bind_admit` and `cache_ignore_query_admit`.  These are
  the pass-6 kernels for the ancestor access-file walk (I47), URL-selected
  alias mapping root (I48) and `DirectoryIndex` cache target/query isolation
  (I49).  `access_file_layer_read` was simplified to remove the mapping-root
  conjunct.  `htaccess::collect_layers_with_root`,
  `cache::request_scope` and the dispatch/`--explain` callers consume these
  predicates; unit plus F50–F52 replays exercise each branch.
- `htaccess_layer_url_base_admit`, `cache_dynamic_handler_admit`,
  `cache_local_error_document_admit` and `cache_key_hex`.  These are the
  pass-7 kernels for URL-mounted rewrite bases (I50), lossless cache-key bytes
  (I51), local `ErrorDocument` cache scoping (I52) and complete dynamic-handler
  classification (I53).  The `.htaccess` walk, cache request scope and key
  builder consume them; unit plus F53–F56 fastcgi-mock/raw-socket replays
  exercise each branch.
- `request_uri_identity_admit` and `htaccess_rewrite_subject_admit`.  These
  are the pass-8 kernels for canonical `%{REQUEST_URI}` identity (I57) and
  filesystem-relative access-file rewrite subjects (I58).  `expr::Context::new`
  consumes the URI predicate, while `rewrite::subject_for` consumes the subject
  predicate and fails closed when an access-file layer cannot produce its
  subject; unit plus F57/F58 replays exercise both.  The `request_plan` module
  now builds one canonical target/mapping/layer set per request or rewrite
  round; dispatch, cache, rewrite contexts and `--explain` consume it (I59),
  and `LayerIdentity` plus the shared subject/URL-mount functions replace the
  duplicate layer arithmetic in `config.rs`, `htaccess.rs` and `rewrite.rs`.
- `explicit_target_layer_admit` and `target_layer_consume_admit`.  These are
  the pass-9 kernels for explicit-target access-layer binding (I60), extended
  by the pass-10 `options_conjoin`/`handler_conjoin_admit`/
  `override_categories_conjoin` meet kernels and the resolved-target/rewrite
  scope invariants (I61).
  `RequestPlan::from_fs_target`/`build_with_fs_path` walk the supplied target
  itself and fail closed if a collected layer is not its ancestor;
  `RequestPlan::evaluate_scope` always consumes a nonempty layer set even
  when the canonical target is outside the lexical `AllowOverride` prefix.
  Unit plus F59/F60 symlinked-document-root/alias, in-root symlink,
  ancestor access-file, `DirectoryIndex`, autoindex, `RemoveHandler` and
  `AllowOverride None`/rewrite-laundering cases
  replays exercise both predicates.
- `cache_key_hex_spec_injective`, `cache_lookup_hit_requires_binding`,
  `cache_lookup_rejects_stale`, `cache_store_request_admit`,
  `cache_store_status_admit`, `cache_store_control_admit`,
  `cache_store_shape_admit`, `cache_store_ttl_admit`, `cache_ttl_clamp`,
  `cache_expiry`, `cache_disk_projected` and `cache_disk_evict`.  These
  mechanize the cache key encoder/refinement, lookup consequences, store
  admission gates, freshness arithmetic and disk projection/eviction steps
  consumed by `cache.rs` (I51, I54).
- `regex_dialect_admit` / `guard_regex` / `compile_regex`.  Every
  configuration- and expression-supplied regex is admitted only after the
  verified dialect guard: backreferences, look-around, other PCRE-only
  constructs, control bytes and oversized patterns fail closed.  The external
  regex engine still supplies the matching semantics for the accepted
  regular subset.
- `directive_disposition`.  The configuration fallback uses a verified
  four-way disposition: security-sensitive unhandled directives fail closed;
  in strict mode every unhandled directive (known or unknown) fails; in
  compatibility mode known module directives warn and unknown directives
  warn.  This is the executable form of I9 and prevents `--strict-config`
  from accepting an effectful but unimplemented directive.
- `access_layer_slot`.  Parsed `.htaccess` rules are translated into
  conditional, Files or top-level layer slots by a verified decision used by
  `collect_layers`.
- `config_line_kind`.  The pure front-end IR classifies a tokenized line as a
  directive, section start or section end using a verified decision.
  `config_frontend::parse_line` consumes this classification.
- `config_section_nesting_allowed`.  The recursive configuration compiler
  checks section transitions through the verified context table.  Raw
  tokenization, directive arguments and directive-specific refinements remain
  the explicit parser-refinement assumption.
- `classify_access_rule`.  `htaccess::collect_layers` uses this verified
  partition: condition/non-normal rules go to the deferred conditional bucket,
  `<Files>` rules to the Files bucket, and everything else to the top-level
  scope.
- `prefilter_sound`.  The I3 fast-path implication is a Verus theorem for both
  prefilters: `htaccess_may_apply_spec` false admits no access-file layer in
  the walk, and a false cache rule prefilter over an unchanged inherited
  `CacheEnable` list keeps `cache_enabled_spec` false.  `cache_prefilter_sound`
  proves the list/append obligation through an explicit preorder flattening of
  rule deltas; the path matcher and parser-to-rule-tree refinement remain the
  stated assumptions.
- `first_match_is_first` / `first_match_none_means_no_match`.  For an ordered
  mapping table encoded as its match-bit vector, the selected entry is the
  first true bit and no true bit means no mapping applies.  This is the I14
  first-match theorem; flattening the runtime alias/redirect/proxy tables into
  the vector remains outside Verus.
- `h2_method_ok`, `h2_head_admit`, `H2BodyState`/`h2_body_append`, and
  `H2Budget`.  The HTTP/2 adapter calls the verified method/head decision and
  advances a verified body budget as it consumes DATA frames.  `H2Settings`
  fixes the builder limits; `H2HeaderState` bounds the decoded header list;
  and `H2Flow` models connection/stream windows and send-buffer bounds.  The
  response path uses h2 reserve/poll capacity before each DATA send, so a
  zero/small client window cannot make the adapter queue unbounded response
  bytes.  `H2Budget` is
  now driven by the connection/task loop: `Begin` at accept, `Finish` when
  the task ends, `Reset` for a `SendResponse::poll_reset` event, a
  `RecvStream` reset error, a timeout, or a send failure, and `Reclaim` from a
  timer equal to the h2 reset-stream duration.  A replay
  theorem preserves both counters for any finite event sequence.  The adapter
  also tracks stream IDs and uses a verified idempotent purge set, so a
  duplicate early-reset/close cleanup is a no-op; this is the
  CVE-2026-23918 primitive.  The ledger's begin path now calls
  `h2_stream_admit`, which proves a new stream ID is neither active nor
  awaiting reset cleanup.  `H2StreamPhase`/`h2_stream_phase_step` fix the
  adapter-local lifecycle and prove `Closed` is absorbing, so a closed ID
  cannot be reopened.  The h2 crate still owns wire framing and resets that it
  handles internally without surfacing to the adapter; that external wire
  behavior is now an explicit assumption rather than an unverified adapter
  component.
- `rewrite_backref_no_qmark`, `rewrite_filesystem_admit`,
  `rewrite_target_external`, `rewrite_internal_path` and
  `rewrite_authority_equal`.  Rewrite backreference/variable expansion uses
  the verified question-mark encoder by default.  External HTTP(S)/scheme-
  relative targets are classified exactly, internal targets are given a
  single leading slash, and same-host internalization compares authority and
  optional decimal port with ASCII case folding.  Absolute rewritten
  filesystem targets are admitted only below the current document/alias root;
  `UnsafePrefixStat` is parsed for compatibility but never changes that base.
- `proxy_target_key`.  Proxy grant binding uses an exact, verified
  length-delimited identity of `(tls, host, port, path)`; host/path NUL
  characters are excluded by the validated inputs.  The runtime converts the
  key to hex for string comparison.
- `cache_lookup_admit`.  Cache hits require matching key, policy fingerprint,
  configuration-generation epoch, `Vary` values and freshness
  (`now < expires`); the runtime uses this verified decision for memory and
  disk entries.
- Cache credential exclusion.  Disk metadata stores response headers, not
  request headers, and explicitly drops Authorization/Proxy-Authorization;
  cache keys include the policy fingerprint, query and a hash of every request
  header, so header-selected authorization branches cannot share an entry.
- Proxy target authority binding.  `ProxyPassMatch` and rewrite `[P]`
  authority templates are rejected when derived from captures or variables;
  targets are canonical and paths are encoded exactly once.  Backend hosts,
  `X-Forwarded-Host`, and the fully serialized upstream request head pass the
  verified token/header predicates before `write_all`.  Backend response
  `Location` values also pass the verified header sanitizer.
- FastCGI script containment.  `script_from_prefix()` and
  `split_path_info()` clean and canonicalize the target inside the configured
  FastCGI prefix or document/alias root; the `PATH_INFO` ancestor walk cannot
  select a file above that base.
- CGI/FastCGI authentication context.  The grant identity is passed into
  `CgiContext`; `build_env()` emits `REMOTE_USER` and `AUTH_TYPE` for both
  local CGI and FastCGI while keeping configured environment entries unable to
  override them.
- Expression filesystem confinement.  `file()` and `filesize()` data paths
  are confined beneath `DOCUMENT_ROOT`; absolute, parent-relative and
  symlink-escaping reads fail closed.  `FileTest` remains metadata-only (and
  is also used by admin `<IfFile>`), so it does not expose file contents.
- `escape_log_bytes`.  Client-derived access-log fields are escaped by a
  verified primitive, including controls, quotes and backslashes.
- HTTP request/header/body and compression budgets.  The verified HTTP/1
  parser plus `H2Settings`, `H2HeaderState`, `H2Flow` and the fixed compression
  cap cover the generic DoS class; the remaining HPACK/zero-window behavior is
  delegated to the explicit h2 wire-framing assumption.
- `cgi_env_entry_admit`.  Configured/rewrite environment entries pass only
  when their key is valid and not a calculated CGI/`HTTP_*` name.
- CGI calculated-environment reservation.  `cgi::build_env` refuses to let
  configured/rewrite environment entries override request, connection or
  identity variables such as `REQUEST_METHOD`, `SCRIPT_FILENAME`,
  `CONTENT_LENGTH`, `REMOTE_ADDR` and `HTTP_*`; custom variables still pass
  through.  CGI stdout/stderr, timeouts, and FastCGI headers are bounded.
- `tls_client_policy_equal` / `ensure_uniform_client_policy`.  Every TLS
  listener requires one client-certificate policy across its virtual hosts;
  mixed `SSLVerifyClient`/`SSLCACertificateFile` configurations fail startup.
  The runtime compares a verified exact identity of verification mode and CA
  path bytes, with absent and present CA distinguished.  Per-location client
  authentication is rejected because Rustls verifies the connection, not an
  individual request; Rustls chain validation itself remains an external
  TLS assumption.
- `host_pattern_matches` / `host_suffix_matches`.  `VHost::matches_name`
  uses verified exact, `*.suffix` and `.suffix` matching with ASCII case
  folding and DNS-label boundaries.  Invalid regex `ServerAlias` patterns are
  rejected at configuration load.
- `first_true_index`.  Virtual-host candidate selection uses the verified
  first-match policy.
- `ipv4_in_net` / `ipv6_in_net` and `first_untrusted_index`.  RemoteIP trust
  chain selection and IP network membership use verified functions.  Literal
  IP/authority parsing remains an explicit assumption.

`crates/server/src/access.rs` also exposes an `AccessGrant` capability with a
concrete `ResourceKey` (vhost, method, URL, filesystem path, proxy target,
cache key, identity).  A grant for `/public/file` cannot authorize
`/private/file`, a different proxy target, or another cache key; the cache,
static file/directory, CGI, FastCGI, HTTP proxy and WebSocket sinks verify the
key.  This is the resource-binding part of I1.  The WebSocket upgrade path
canonicalizes the raw target, runs the same rewrite gate, evaluates the target
scope, and uses the same method/access helper before taking the connection.  A
rewrite that changes the filesystem target re-evaluates
`<Directory>`/`<Files>`/`.htaccess` policy for that target before dispatch.

Static file/directory grants now carry the opened inode and a symlink target
is re-authorized.  Proxy/cache grants remain path/URL-bound, and CGI/FastCGI
script descriptors are selected after the grant rather than bound to an
inode.  Those are the next resource-binding steps, along with the parser, the regex engine and expression leaf evaluators, and
directory sort/pairing outside Verus.

Security-sensitive unimplemented directives fail closed in compatibility mode.
The classifier covers the auth/TLS/proxy/filter/DAV/LDAP/cache families by
name prefix, not only an explicit denylist; the warning-only fallback is
reserved for directives with no access, auth, proxy, filter or path-policy
effect.

### Policy-core migration

The first `ScopePolicy` slice now exists in
`crates/server/src/scope_policy.rs`:

- `OptionsPolicy` stores the ordered Set/Add/Remove sequence and evaluates it
  through the verified `options_apply` primitive;
- `OverridePolicy` owns `AllowOverride`, `AllowOverrideList` and
  `Nonfatal=...` inheritance, with child-presence merge semantics;
- `AuthorizationPolicy` owns `requires`, `auth_merging`, `AllowMethods` and
  legacy `Order`/`Allow`/`Deny` state, using the verified `auth_merge_kind`
  decision and child-presence inheritance;
- `HeaderPolicy` owns header add/set/unset lists, expiration state,
  cookies and Vary, with append/child-presence merge rules;
- `EnvironmentPolicy` owns `SetEnv`/`UnsetEnv`/`PassEnv`/`SetEnvIf` state;
- `ContentPolicy` owns directory defaults, MIME add/remove/force types,
  ETag/sendfile/directory-slash and access-file names;
- `MappingPolicy` owns aliases, redirects, handlers and unsupported filters;
- `ErrorDocumentPolicy` owns the ordered status-code document list with
  reverse child-wins lookup;
- `RewriteCachePolicy` owns rewrite engine/maps/base/rules and cache
  enable/disable state; pending rewrite conditions remain section-local;
- `CompressionPolicy` owns compression rules and deflate/brotli settings;
- `ProxyPolicy` owns proxy rules, pass/reverse mappings and the proxy CA file;
- `AuthorizationPolicy` also owns the auth type/name and user/group file
  handles;
- `ContentPolicy` also owns the document root;
- `Scope` now contains only policy objects rather than the old ad-hoc fields;
- parser construction, access checks, `.htaccess` gating and cache policy
  fingerprints read the policy objects directly.

The `ScopePolicy` migration is complete at the runtime-data level: `Scope`
now stores policy objects for all former fields.  The next formal step is the
abstract model/projection proof over these policy objects.

### Parser-proof starting point

`crates/server/src/config_frontend.rs` now isolates the pure front-end pieces
that the proof will target:

- logical-line accumulation with source line numbers;
- Apache-style quoted/escaped tokenization;
- a small `ConfigLine` IR for directives, section starts and section ends.

Both the configuration parser and the `.htaccess` parser use the shared
tokenizer; the configuration compiler uses the shared logical-line helper.
The IR is deliberately free of filesystem access, include expansion, section
context and directive dispatch.  The config compiler and `.htaccess`
`parse_block` now consume the IR for line classification, and
`config_line_kind` plus `config_section_nesting_allowed` are verified and used
by the runtime.  `OptionsPolicy` and `OverridePolicy` are the first migrated
policy objects; authorization is the next slice.  The remaining proof work is
the byte-level tokenizer refinement, directive-argument semantics, and the full
IR-to-concrete `Scope` mapping; the AccessLayer slot and directive disposition
boundaries are already verified.

### Remaining refinement boundary

The verified plan is consumed by the evaluator.  The root-to-leaf directory
sort/pairing and raw configuration/access-file tokenization remain outside
mechanical proof; container/list field merging and the security disposition /
layer-slot translation use verified helpers.  The parser is covered by the
explicit `configuration parsing refines the model` assumption.

The authorization decision, access-phase interleaving, Options algebra,
scalar overrides, `.htaccess` rule classification, expression truthiness,
comparison and glob semantics, and rewrite condition-chain folding are
verified kernels.  The parser-to-model
translation, Directory sort, regex semantics and the
filesystem view are explicit assumptions, not hidden axioms.

## 10b. Verification progress ledger

Verification progress is tracked as **security obligations and proof debt**,
not as a count of verified functions. The machine-readable ledger is
`docs/verification-status.json`; the gate is:

```sh
python3 tests/verification_status.py
python3 tests/verification_status.py --run-verus
```

The current ledger (2026-10-25) is:

- weighted obligations: **13.0 / 26.0 (50.0%)** if partial obligations receive
  half credit;
- proof debt: **6 / 6** — 0 named unverified security components, 0 partially
  bound sinks, 6 assumptions and 0 accepted unmodeled security-directive
  classes;
- sinks: **8/8** grant-required, **8/8** path/target-bound, **4/8**
  inode-bound, **3/8** backend-target-bound, **3/8** policy-key-bound;
- unexplained adversarial replay failures: **0** (the CVE replay corpus is
  not yet systematic; the separate finding-replay suite covers F23–F38);
- Verus: **218 functions, 0 errors**, with no `assume` or `external_body`
  proof escapes.

The gate fails when proof debt exceeds its budget, the weighted score drops
below its floor, an inode-bound sink regresses, a proof escape appears, or a
sink stops requiring a grant. Raising a budget is an explicit change to the
ledger, not an implicit effect of adding code.

## 11. Current test oracle

## 11a. Acceptance/rejection obligations

Two finite obligations are checked explicitly:

- **Acceptance:** for every configuration in the supported directive/context
  grammar, if Apache accepts it, vapached accepts it.
- **Rejection:** every malformed/invalid configuration in that same grammar is
  rejected by vapached.

`tests/config_grammar.py` enumerates the grammar and currently reports **0
divergences** against Apache.  This is exhaustive for the listed finite
subset, not a proof over arbitrary Apache syntax.

## 11b. Test oracle

The pre-proof suite is:

- `tests/conformance.py` — 165 fixed Apache differential/conformance tests.
- `tests/config_semantics.py` — 194 systematic generated cases, plus
  `--random N --seed S` deterministic randomized cases.
- `tests/config_validity.py` — `apache2 -t` vs `vapached -t` context matrix.
- `tests/config_grammar.py` — finite supported directive/context grammar,
  including valid and invalid argument/section forms.
- `tests/adversarial_regressions.py` — end-to-end F23–F38 finding replays
  (authorization transforms, cache identity, alias/rewrite/FastCGI
  containment, request-header effects and CGI identity).
- Rust unit invariants in `config.rs`, `htaccess.rs`, `access.rs`, `cache.rs`,
  `fastcgi.rs`, `proxy.rs`, `rewrite.rs` and `server.rs`.

Until the model is mechanized, any change to merge order or override gating
must be accompanied by a differential case.  The generated suite is the
current definition of “matches Apache” for the covered surface.

### 11c — Unproven security-critical production coverage

Modules that are too complex or protocol-dependent for the current Verus model
are tracked separately from the proof ledger:

```sh
tests/coverage.sh
python3 tests/security_coverage.py --check
```

The tracker measures **production lines before each file's test module** and
currently enforces 100% for:

- `fastcgi.rs` — record parsing, spooling, script/PATH_INFO containment,
  environment derivation, error paths and process boundary;
- `http.rs` — request-head/body framing, chunk/trailer bounds, spool-file
  creation, response framing headers and short-body failure paths;
- `tls.rs` — certificate/key parsing, SNI selection, OCSP refresh, client-auth
  policy and listener construction.

The remaining high-risk surfaces (`cgi`, `h2`, `proxy`, `server`,
`htaccess`, `config`, `expr`, `rewrite`) are reported with their current
production coverage and promoted to enforced 100% one at a time.  A module is
not considered closed merely because its test module is covered; the tracker
excludes test-only code from the denominator.

## 12. Known gaps before formal proof

- Configuration phases and access-file interleaving now run through a verified
  plan consumed by the single production evaluator.  The directory
  sort/pairing and raw parser tokenization are still outside Verus and remain
  covered by the explicit `configuration parsing refines the model`
  assumption.  Container/list field merging, directive disposition and
  `.htaccess` layer-slot translation use verified helpers.
- Some module-specific merge rules are not modelled.  `AllowOverrideList`,
  `Nonfatal=...`, `Include`/`IncludeOptional` and the covered contexts are now
  implemented or covered by the differential/context matrices.
- Regex semantics are assumed, not proved.
- Vhost/Include precedence is only lightly covered by the generated suite.
- `--explain` now lists matching nested configuration rules with phase,
  order and condition result, and traces access files with their override
  mode, list, nonfatal mode and parsed rule count.  It does not yet show the
  action-by-action merge of every `.htaccess` directive.
- I1 is capability-enforced for cache/file/directory/CGI/FastCGI/proxy and the
  WebSocket tunnel path.  A few explicit pre-auth error paths still construct
  responses before an access check; those are documented separately.
- I3 prefilters are now Verus theorems (`prefilter_sound`,
  `htaccess_prefilter_sound`, `cache_prefilter_sound`) over the boolean/list
  model.  The path-pattern matcher and the parser-to-flattened-rule-list
  refinement are still explicit assumptions; the cache lookup also requires an
  `AccessGrant` at runtime.
- The durable `.htaccess` cache/metadata invalidation is outside the model.

## 13. Apache CVE triage

The NVD CPE `apache:http_server` snapshot is triaged in
`docs/cve/apache2-cve-matrix.json` (371 CVEs).  The current result is:

- 370 prevented in principle by construction, verified primitives or
  fail-closed rejection,
- 0 partially covered,
- 1 not covered by the formal specification,
- 0 unclassified.

The sole uncovered row is the external Rustls certificate parser
(`CVE-2004-0488`), treated as an explicit dependency assumption.
The complete methodology and limits are in `docs/cve/README.md`; regenerate
and validate with:

```sh
python3 tests/cve_matrix.py
python3 tests/cve_matrix.py --check
```

This is a static per-CVE triage, not a claim that a working PoC replay exists
for every row.
