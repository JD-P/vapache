# PCRE2 compatibility-engine benchmark

Measured 2026-10-30 after the P23 remediation on Linux 6.18.55, an AMD EPYC
9V74 worker (5 available cores), Rust 1.99.1. The benchmark is single-threaded,
uses release builds, reports the median of seven samples, and compares the same
`captures` API because that is what vapache expressions use.

The “vapache” column is the safe-Rust compatibility frontend and deterministic
automata backend guarded by the Verus-verified engine-mode and resource
admission kernels. The engine is tiered: construction creates a bounded Pike
VM, the first search uses it, and the second search builds a shared lazy-DFA
tier. Neither tier enables bounded or recursive backtracking. The automata
implementation itself is a documented proof assumption, not code translated
from Verus.

```sh
cargo run -p vapache-pcre2 --release --example pcre2_benchmark
```

The C columns use the test-only PCRE2 10.46 oracle through `pcre2` 0.2.11,
once as the interpreter and once with JIT requested. Times are nanoseconds per
operation; lower is better.

Interpretation:

- Compilation is now 7.1–24.7× the C interpreter (previously 13.9–96.0×) and
  1.2–3.2× C JIT compilation. Parsing and structural work accounting remain
  deliberate costs; lazy-DFA construction is deferred until reuse proves the
  expression hot.
- “Compile + first captures” makes that deferral visible. The first search is
  bounded Pike-VM execution, so one-shot long scans beat the C interpreter but
  can trail C JIT. The second and later searches use the shared lazy-DFA tier.
- Warm captures beat the C interpreter in every case. They also beat C JIT in
  four of five cases; the remaining alternation case is 1.32× C JIT. Inline
  capture slots and a group-zero fast path remove allocator and submatch work
  from the common no-explicit-capture case.
- The counted-repetition row is a security-policy comparison rather than a
  successful-match throughput comparison. Vapache rejects the request at its
  verified work gate in about 0.24 µs; PCRE2 executes it. Before P23-A, the
  vapache engine admitted this shape and the original adversarial live test
  measured roughly 350 ms. The checked-in row is a warmed median-of-seven;
  each C sample executes once while the much cheaper guard uses 10,000
  iterations per sample.

Microbenchmarks are sensitive to CPU placement and allocator state. The
checked-in example is the source of truth and should be rerun on deployment
hardware for capacity planning.
